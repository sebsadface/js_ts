%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question# 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{question}{1. The Level Is in the Details (10 points)}
   \begin{part}
        \begin{answer}
            \textbf{Correctness Level:} -1

            \textbf{Explanation:} Since the function is defined on pair of colors where each color is either red, green, or blue, so we have $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ total possible inputs. Because we can use exhaustive testing on the small number of inputs, the function requires a correctness level of -1.

        \end{answer}
   \end{part}
   
   \begin{part}
        \begin{answer}
            \textbf{Correctness Level:} 0

            \textbf{Explanation:} Because the function only contains a single returning statement and the behavior of the function is already described by the mathematical function in the spec, the function requires a correctness level of 0.
